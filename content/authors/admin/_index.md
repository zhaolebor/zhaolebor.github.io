I'm an aspiring engineer and entrepreneur building robots for the next generations. I believe robots, alongside humans, can make the world a better place.

I am interested in vision-based data-driven robot learning in human-robot hybrid environments. Currently a Master of Science in Robotics student at University of Pennsylvania, I am primarily working on robot learning from human research and open-source autonomous driving. 

Previously, I obtained my BA/BS from Swarthmore College double majoring in Computer Science and Engineering. I have worked in the AI, robotics, and venture capital industries.
