Imagine yourself buying herbs like cilantro, parsley, or scallion for your next gourmet creation, only to find out athe herbs became wilted, slimy or wet after a few days. An easy way to store your herbs and keep them fresh for longer is to soak the roots in water. Introducing 3verFresh, a herb preserver that is affordable and easy to use.

As the design lead, I was in charge of modeling in Rhino and making subsequent changes after the alpha pitch, 3D printing, fitting the parts and attachments. I also made the assembly drawing, BOM and the rendering for the posters. I also contributed to the brainstorming of the different functionality and brand marketing.
